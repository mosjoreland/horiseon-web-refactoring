# Code Refactor Starter Code
# <Horiseon>

## Issues to be fixed
* The website should have a codebase that follows accessibility standards
* This is necessary so the site is optimized for search engines

## How the issues were fixed
* Added the following tags: <header>, <nav>, <figure>, <section>,  <aside>, and <footer> to provide more semantic syntax than the original tags
* Added <alt> tags to all images so users accessing the site via screen readers are able to understand everything that is on the site
* Changed the last heading from <h3> to <h4> to maintain a sequential order to the elements
* Created a more descriptive <title> for search engine optimization and to add a more professional look to the website's tab
