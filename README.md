# Code Refactor Starter Code
# <Horiseon>

## Issues to be fixed
* The website should have a codebase that follows accessibility standards.
* This is necessary so the site is optimized for search engines.

## How the issues were fixed
* Added the following tags: header, nav, figure, section,  aside, and footer to provide more semantic syntax than the original tags.
* Added alt tags to all images so users accessing the site via screen readers are able to understand everything that is on the site.
* Changed the last heading from h3 to h4 to maintain a sequential order to the elements.
* Created a more descriptive title for search engine optimization and to add a more professional look to the website's tab.
* Simplified code for the following elements: aside section, aside h3's, aside images, main sections, main h2's, and main images by making it one css edit
* Added css variabes to get rid of repetative code

## Asistance
* Chris Braid helped guide me through the steps through a zoom tutoring session.
